1. Compiling

The software should compile on every platform on which GPhoto and QT is
supported.

1.1 MacOS

Creating the Makefile with the following commando
 qmake -spec macx-g++ -config debug QTGPhotoInfo.pro
and the type make to build the program.

If you have installed gphoto in a different location, please have a look at
the file local.pro.tmp, which should be copied to local.pro

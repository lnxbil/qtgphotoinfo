You need the following packages (most recent versions):
 * libtool (using LGPL licensed libdl) 
 * pkg-config (GPL, but not using to link against)
 * libusb (LGPL)
 * libusb-compat (LGPL)
 * jpeg-6b (some kind of royality and fee-free license)
 * libgphoto2 (LGPL)
 * QT 4.6 (LGPL Version available) 

So using libgphoto2 is completly linked against LGPL libraries.

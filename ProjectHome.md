# Platform independent #

In general, this library is only based on [libGPhoto2](http://gphoto.sourceforge.net/proj/libgphoto2/) and [QT](http://qt.nokia.com/products/) and threrefore in principle as independent as both libraries. Currently, it is only tested on [MacOS](https://code.google.com/p/qtgphotoinfo/wiki/CompileMacOS) and Linux (Ubuntu 64-bit)
